## Project Overview

This project represents an evolution of our previous class project, significantly enhancing and updating the 3D model of our school. The improved model serves dual purposes:
- Providing an intuitive navigation system for visitors
- Implementing a comprehensive environmental monitoring system across classrooms

## System Components

### 3D School Model Navigation (will use this model)
- Intuitive three-dimensional visualization of the entire school campus
- Interactive navigation paths for visitors unfamiliar with the building layout
- Information points highlighting key locations
- Accessibility features
- Mobile and web-based interfaces

## Available Formats

The 3D model is available in multiple formats:
- FBX (.fbx)
- glTF/GLB (.glb)
- Wavefront OBJ (.obj) with material files (.mtl)
- STL (.stl)

## Current Version

- v2.0.0-alpha (latest)
- v2.0.0-release (coming soon)

## Context

This project addresses air quality issues that affect approximately 90% of schools in Austria, which can negatively impact student concentration, health, and overall learning outcomes, also strangers, for example parents looking for teachers, always have trouble finding the room they were told to go to, with the help of the 3D model and a navigation we can help strangers find their destination much easier.
